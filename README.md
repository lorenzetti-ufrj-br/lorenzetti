# 🔬 Lorenzetti Simulator 

Lorenzetti is a **dedicated HEP framework** conceptualized to streamline the Research & Development (R&D) of **calorimetry signal processing**, **reconstruction**, and **triggering algorithms**. While modern LHC experiments rely on massive, monolithic software stacks, Lorenzetti provides a **lightweight, modular, and stand-alone** environment that grants researchers direct access to high-fidelity simulation data. Built upon the robust **Geant4** toolkit, Lorenzetti simulates the complete physics of particle showers within complex detector geometries. However, unlike general-purpose simulators, it focuses deeply on the **readout chain**: transforming raw energy deposits into realistic electronic pulses, digitizing them, and reconstructing the original particle properties.

This framework addresses a critical gap in the community: **Access to quality data**. Experiment-specific data is often restricted or difficult to generate for outsiders. Lorenzetti democratizes this by establishing a standard reference for:
- 🧠 **Algorithm Development**: Fast prototyping of filters (Optimal Filtering, Wiener), clustering algorithms, and jet reconstruction.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning**: Generating massive, labelled datasets ideal for training Neural Networks (e.g., for *anomaly detection*, *pileup mitigation*, or *super-resolution*).
- ⚡ **Trigger Studies**: Simulating hardware-level constraints to test fast decision-making logic.

### 🌪️ Advanced Pileup Simulation via Overlay
One of Lorenzetti's most defining features is its ability to realistically simulate **high-luminosity environments** through a sophisticated **Overlay Strategy**. High Energy Physics experiments often face the challenge of **Pileup**—multiple proton-proton collisions occurring simultaneously. Lorenzetti accurately models this by overlaying background "Minimum Bias" events onto the signal event of interest. 

Crucially, it handles both **In-Time Pileup** (simultaneous collisions) and **Out-of-Time Pileup** (signals from previous or subsequent bunch crossings that distort the current measurement). This is achieved by convolving the energy deposits with the detector's realistic **electronic pulse shapes** over a configurable time window. This setup provides a perfect playground for developing cutting-edge **Pileup Mitigation algorithms** (e.g., using timing information or deep learning) to recover clean signals from high-noise backgrounds, mimicking the harsh conditions of the **HL-LHC**.

## 🚀 Installation

The recommended way to use Lorenzetti is via pre-built container images (**Docker** or **Singularity**), which come with all dependencies pre-installed.

### Singularity (Recommended)
```bash
singularity pull docker://lorenzetti/lorenzetti:latest
singularity run lorenzetti_latest.sif
```

### Manual Build
For development, you can clone and build the source inside the container:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorenzetti-ufrj-br/lorenzetti.git && cd lorenzetti
make
source build/lzt_setup.sh
```

📄 **Full Installation Guide**: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)

## 📚 Tutorials

We provide several Jupyter Notebooks to help you get started:

- 📘 **[Usage Guide](notebooks/usage.ipynb)**: General introduction to using the framework.
- ⚛️ **[Particle Generation](notebooks/generation.ipynb)**: How to generate physics events (e.g., Z bosons, Jets).

## ⚡ Quick Example: Zee Event Chain

Run a full chain reconstruction for $Z \to e^+e^-$ events (without pileup) directly from your terminal:

1. **Generate 10 physics events** (Z boson decaying to electrons):
   ```bash
   gen_zee.py --nov 10 -o Zee.EVT.root
   ```

2. **Simulate detector response** (Energy hits in calorimeters):
   ```bash
   simu_trf.py -i Zee.EVT.root -o Zee.HIT.root -nt 10
   ```
   > **Note**: `-nt` specifies the number of events to process.

3. **Digitization** (Convert energy hits to electronic signals):
   ```bash
   digit_trf.py -i Zee.HIT.root -o Zee.ESD.root
   ```

4. **Reconstruction** (Build cluster objects):
   ```bash
   reco_trf.py -i Zee.ESD.root -o Zee.AOD.root
   ```

5. **Analysis** (Dump content to a flat ROOT Ntuple):
   ```bash
   ntuple_trf.py -i Zee.AOD.root -o Zee.NTUPLE.root
   ```

## ✅ Tests & Validation

Lorenzetti is rigorously tested using Github Actions. The validation workflow includes:

1.  **Event Generation**: `gen_zee.py`, `gen_jets.py`, `gen_minbias.py`
2.  **Simulation**: `simu_trf.py` (Hit generation)
3.  **Merging**: `merge_trf.py` (Pileup mixing)
4.  **Digitalization**: `digit_trf.py` (Electronic signal simulation)
5.  **Reconstruction**: `reco_trf.py` (Object reconstruction)
6.  **Analysis**: `ntuple_trf.py` (Root Ntuple dumping)

You can run these commands manually (as seen in `.github/workflows/reco_sequence.yml`) to validate your local environment.

## 🏗️ Detector Construction (Version 1)

The standard detector in Lorenzetti aims to mimic the properties of modern high-granularity calorimeters used in LHC experiments (such as ATLAS). It is constructed as a **cylindrical 4π detector** with two main systems:

### 1. Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL)
A sampling calorimeter designed to measure electrons and photons with high precision.
- **Material**: **Lead** ($Pb$) absorber plates interleaved with **Liquid Argon** ($LAr$) as the active medium.
- **Structure**:
    - **Pre-Sampler**: A thin layer to correct for energy loss upstream.
    - **Layer 1 (Strips)**: Finely segmented ($\Delta\eta \approx 0.003$) for $\pi^0/\gamma$ separation.
    - **Layer 2 (Middle)**: The thickest layer (55 radiation lengths) containing most of the shower energy.
    - **Layer 3 (Back)**: Estimates energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter.

### 2. Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL)
Located outside the ECAL, this sampling calorimeter measures jets and missing energy.
- **Material**: **Iron** ($Fe$) absorber plates with **Plastic Scintillator** tiles.
- **Structure**: Divided into 3 longitudinal layers with coarser granularity ($\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi \approx 0.1 \times 0.1$).

### 📊 Detector Layers & Granularity

| System | Layer | Name | Material | Granularity (Δη × Δφ) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **ECAL (Barrel)** | 0 | Pre-Sampler | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.1 |
| | 1 | Front (Strips) | LAr / Pb | 0.003125 × 0.1 |
| | 2 | Middle | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.025 |
| | 3 | Back | LAr / Pb | 0.050 × 0.025 |
| **TileCal (Barrel)** | 1 | Front | Scint. / Fe | 0.1 × 0.1 |
| | 2 | Middle | Scint. / Fe | 0.1 × 0.1 |
| | 3 | Back | Scint. / Fe | 0.2 × 0.1 |
| **EMEC (EndCap)** | 0 | Pre-Sampler | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.1 |
| | 1 | Front | LAr / Pb | varies (0.003-0.006) × 0.1 |
| | 2 | Middle | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.025 / 0.1 × 0.1|
| | 3 | Back | LAr / Pb | 0.050 × 0.025 / 0.1 × 0.1|
| **HEC (EndCap)** | 1-3 | All Layers | LAr / Cu | 0.1 × 0.1 / 0.2 × 0.2 |

The geometry is highly customizable via Python scripts, allowing users to modify layer depths, material composition, and segmentation without recompiling the C++ core.
