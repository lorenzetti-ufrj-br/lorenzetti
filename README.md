# 🔬 Lorenzetti Simulator 

Lorenzetti is a **general-purpose framework** designed to support **signal reconstruction** and **triggering** studies in High Energy Physics (HEP) calorimeters. Described in *[Computer Physics Communications (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2023.108671)*, it aims to democratize access to high-quality simulation data and foster algorithm development.

We expect to enable the community to mitigate bottlenecks for R&D in processing algorithms by providing:

- ⚛️ **Unified Simulation**: Seamless integration of comprehensive physics simulation (Geant4) with low-level calorimetry readout.
- 🔓 **Open Access Data**: Free-to-use, high-fidelity datasets for proof-of-concepts (POCs) and independent research.

By providing a streamlined environment—independent of massive experimental software stacks—Lorenzetti allows researchers to easily develop, benchmark, and publish novel processing algorithms (e.g., for fast trigger systems or anomaly detection).

## 🚀 Installation

The recommended way to use Lorenzetti is via pre-built container images (**Docker** or **Singularity**), which come with all dependencies pre-installed.

### Singularity (Recommended)
```bash
singularity pull docker://lorenzetti/lorenzetti:latest
singularity run lorenzetti_latest.sif
```

### Manual Build
For development, you can clone and build the source inside the container:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lorenzetti-ufrj-br/lorenzetti.git && cd lorenzetti
make
source build/lzt_setup.sh
```

📄 **Full Installation Guide**: [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md)

## 📚 Tutorials

We provide several Jupyter Notebooks to help you get started:

- 📘 **[Usage Guide](docs/notebooks/usage.ipynb)**: General introduction to using the framework.
- ⚛️ **[Particle Generation](docs/notebooks/generation.ipynb)**: How to generate physics events (e.g., Z bosons, Jets).
- 💥 **[Simulation](docs/notebooks/simulation.ipynb)**: Simulating detector response and interactions.
- 🕵️ **[Anomaly Injection](docs/notebooks/anomaly.ipynb)**: Tutorial on injecting anomalies for study.

## ⚡ Quick Example: Zee Event Chain

Run a full chain reconstruction for $Z \to e^+e^-$ events (without pileup) directly from your terminal:

1. **Generate 10 physics events** (Z boson decaying to electrons):
   ```bash
   gen_zee.py --nov 10 -o Zee.EVT.root
   ```

2. **Simulate detector response** (Energy hits in calorimeters):
   ```bash
   simu_trf.py -i Zee.EVT.root -o Zee.HIT.root -nt 10
   ```
   > **Note**: `-nt` specifies the number of events to process.

3. **Digitization** (Convert energy hits to electronic signals):
   ```bash
   digit_trf.py -i Zee.HIT.root -o Zee.ESD.root
   ```

4. **Reconstruction** (Build cluster objects):
   ```bash
   reco_trf.py -i Zee.ESD.root -o Zee.AOD.root
   ```

5. **Analysis** (Dump content to a flat ROOT Ntuple):
   ```bash
   ntuple_trf.py -i Zee.AOD.root -o Zee.NTUPLE.root
   ```

## ✅ Tests & Validation

Lorenzetti is rigorously tested using Github Actions. The validation workflow includes:

1.  **Event Generation**: `gen_zee.py`, `gen_jets.py`, `gen_minbias.py`
2.  **Simulation**: `simu_trf.py` (Hit generation)
3.  **Merging**: `merge_trf.py` (Pileup mixing)
4.  **Digitalization**: `digit_trf.py` (Electronic signal simulation)
5.  **Reconstruction**: `reco_trf.py` (Object reconstruction)
6.  **Analysis**: `ntuple_trf.py` (Root Ntuple dumping)

You can run these commands manually (as seen in `.github/workflows/reco_sequence.yml`) to validate your local environment.

## 🏗️ Detector Construction (Version 1)

The standard detector in Lorenzetti aims to mimic the properties of modern high-granularity calorimeters used in LHC experiments (such as ATLAS). It is constructed as a **cylindrical 4π detector** with two main systems:

### 1. Electromagnetic Calorimeter (ECAL)
A sampling calorimeter designed to measure electrons and photons with high precision.
- **Material**: **Lead** ($Pb$) absorber plates interleaved with **Liquid Argon** ($LAr$) as the active medium.
- **Structure**:
    - **Pre-Sampler**: A thin layer to correct for energy loss upstream.
    - **Layer 1 (Strips)**: Finely segmented ($\Delta\eta \approx 0.003$) for $\pi^0/\gamma$ separation.
    - **Layer 2 (Middle)**: The thickest layer (55 radiation lengths) containing most of the shower energy.
    - **Layer 3 (Back)**: Estimates energy leakage into the hadronic calorimeter.

### 2. Hadronic Calorimeter (HCAL)
Located outside the ECAL, this sampling calorimeter measures jets and missing energy.
- **Material**: **Iron** ($Fe$) absorber plates with **Plastic Scintillator** tiles.
- **Structure**: Divided into 3 longitudinal layers with coarser granularity ($\Delta\eta \times \Delta\phi \approx 0.1 \times 0.1$).

### 📊 Detector Layers & Granularity

| System | Layer | Name | Material | Granularity (Δη × Δφ) |
| :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **ECAL (Barrel)** | 0 | Pre-Sampler | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.1 |
| | 1 | Front (Strips) | LAr / Pb | 0.003125 × 0.1 |
| | 2 | Middle | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.025 |
| | 3 | Back | LAr / Pb | 0.050 × 0.025 |
| **TileCal (Barrel)** | 1 | Front | Scint. / Fe | 0.1 × 0.1 |
| | 2 | Middle | Scint. / Fe | 0.1 × 0.1 |
| | 3 | Back | Scint. / Fe | 0.2 × 0.1 |
| **EMEC (EndCap)** | 0 | Pre-Sampler | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.1 |
| | 1 | Front | LAr / Pb | varies (0.003-0.006) × 0.1 |
| | 2 | Middle | LAr / Pb | 0.025 × 0.025 / 0.1 × 0.1|
| | 3 | Back | LAr / Pb | 0.050 × 0.025 / 0.1 × 0.1|
| **HEC (EndCap)** | 1-3 | All Layers | LAr / Cu | 0.1 × 0.1 / 0.2 × 0.2 |

The geometry is highly customizable via Python scripts, allowing users to modify layer depths, material composition, and segmentation without recompiling the C++ core.
